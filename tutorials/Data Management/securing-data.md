# Securing data

Your data needs to be private, such as where you have been, what you have searched for, and your identity documents.

## The simple things

1. Anything that you download, can hack you.

    If it looks like a PDF document and you open it, it could hack you.

    Make sure you trust the person that sent you the file. For example if their email ends in ".gov.mt". However even then you should be careful.

    Always ask for important information in text form sent through email, or a link to a safe site where you can view it such as Google drive.

2. Do not plug in USB drives that you do not own.

    USB's can hack you, break the computer, or worst of all, [explode in your face](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/ecuador-journalist-usb-bomb-ecuavisa). Simple: **If you did not buy it, do not plug it in!**
