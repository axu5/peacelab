# Data backups

Data and files are very important digital assets. Such as work, identity, or travel documents.

So how do you make sure you do not lose these documents? Simple, the 3-2-1 rule!

This is what would be done in an ideal world, but of course it might not be manageable for everyone

## Three

Keep 3 copies of the data.

Keeping 3 copies of your important data is an absolute must. If there is something digital, like sentimental photos, that you cannot lose: copy it 3 times.

## Two

Keep 2 backups on different storage media.

If you have a work laptop, copy your most important data onto a USB stick. If your work laptop dies, you still have your important data! If your USB dies, you still have your important data!

## One

Keep 1 backup away from your main computer/ house/ work.

Store your data somewhere remote. This can be in a bank vault, or more commonly on webservices such as Google drive.

In case your laptop gets stolen, with the USB plugged in, or your house sets on fire, or something disasterous happens. You still have your important data!
